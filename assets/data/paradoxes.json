Most people vastly underestimate the probability of coincidences in relatively small groups, thinking linearly rather than considering all possible pair combinations.",

The term 'crocodilite' came to mean any similarly constructed logical trap where someone admits to something that is then used against them.",

      "The False Positive Paradox, also known as the Base Rate Paradox, was first systematically studied in the 1960s during early research on medical diagnostics and decision theory. Researchers noticed that even highly accurate tests could be misleading when used to screen for rare conditions, leading to unnecessary anxiety and medical procedures.",

Their famous 'jam study' showed that consumers were more likely to purchase jam when presented with 6 options rather than 24.",

It challenges traditional economic assumptions that more choices always improve welfare, showing instead that the cognitive costs of choosing can outweigh the benefits of having more options, especially when choices are complex or similar.",
      "The Paradox of Choice has influenced product design, marketing strategies, public policy, and user experience design. It explains phenomena like decision fatigue and has led to recommendations for 'choice architecture' that helps people navigate complex decision environments without overwhelming them with options."

    "description": "Basic economics says demand falls when prices rise, but Giffen goods violate this law. When bread prices rise, very poor families might buy more bread, not less. Why? Because bread is their cheapest source of calories, and when it gets expensive, they can't afford meat anymore, so they substitute back to even more bread despite its higher price.

However, Giffen himself never published this observation, and Marshall may have been describing a hypothetical rather than observed behavior.",
      "The paradox remained largely theoretical for over a century because Giffen goods are extremely rare and difficult to identify empirically. It wasn't until 2008 that economists Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller provided the first rigorous empirical evidence of Giffen behavior, observing it with rice consumption in Hunan Province, China, and noodle consumption in Gansu Province.",
      "The Giffen Paradox is important for understanding how extreme poverty affects consumption behavior and challenges basic assumptions in economic theory. It demonstrates that the law of demand, while generally reliable, can break down under specific conditions involving necessity goods, extreme budget constraints, and limited substitution possibilities."
